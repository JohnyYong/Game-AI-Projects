My experience working on this project: Definitely simpler than the previous project, was not
able to recognise that analyse agent vision function was actually the search function, which
caused me to somehow thought that it was related to the hide&seek mechanics. Fixed project 2's
inconsistency and recovered missing waypoints for catmull.
