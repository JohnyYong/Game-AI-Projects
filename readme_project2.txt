My experience working on this project:
Tons of fun, especially on optimising the speed for A* to work whilst passing all the tests.
Learnt quite a bit through bucket list and bits management in regards to pre-computing neighbour 
nodes, not to mention caching the projects. The A* algorithm is straightforward and blends well with several different calculation techniques which is intriguing to learn.
